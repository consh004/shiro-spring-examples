# shiro-spring-examples
A series of examples of using [Apache Shiro][1] for authentication and Spring Java Config as the official Shiro examples use XML.

The modules will build on each other somewhat with a simple form based application first, then one with LDAP then finally, one that uses LDAP and falls back to simple auth as an alternative.
